## 1. Tech Stack Recommendation

### Primary Choice: **Ren'Py**

| Criteria | Ren'Py | Unity+Naninovel | Godot+Dialogic | Custom Web |
|----------|--------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| VN-specific features | Built-in | Plugin ($150+) | Plugin | From scratch |
| Save/Load/Skip | Built-in | Built-in | Partial | From scratch |
| Localization | Excellent | Good | Basic | Manual |
| 1440p Support | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Learning Curve | Low | Medium | Medium | High |
| Build Size | Small (~50MB) | Large (~200MB+) | Medium | Small |
| Community/Docs | Excellent for VN | General | Growing | N/A |
| Cost | Free | Unity+$150 | Free | Free |

**Recommendation: Ren'Py** because:
1. Purpose-built for visual novels - all core features are built-in
2. Excellent Chinese/CJK text support out of the box
3. Built-in translation system for English version later
4. Handles resolution scaling elegantly
5. Python-based scripting (easy to read/write)
6. Industry standard (Doki Doki Literature Club, countless commercial VNs)
7. Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Web export

**When to consider alternatives:**
- Unity: If you need complex gameplay mechanics (RPG systems, mini-games)
- Godot: If this will become a hybrid VN/game with heavy gameplay
- Web: If browser-first deployment is critical

## 2. Resolution & Display Strategy

### Base Resolution: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- Scales cleanly to 1440p (2560x1440)
- Scales down to 720p for lower-end devices
- Ren'Py handles letterboxing/pillarboxing automatically

### Asset Specifications (for artists)
| Asset Type | Recommended Size | Format |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| Backgrounds | 1920x1080 (or 2560x1440 for 1440p native) | PNG/WebP |
| Character Sprites | ~1200-1600px height | PNG (transparent) |
| CG/Event Images | 1920x1080 | PNG/JPG |
| UI Elements | Vector or 2x scale | PNG (transparent) |

## 4. Feature Checklist

### Core UX (Built-in, needs configuration)
- [x] Left-click to advance dialogue
- [x] Right-click to open game menu
- [x] Skip (hold Ctrl)
- [x] Auto-read mode
- [x] Save system (multiple slots)
- [x] Load system
- [x] Backlog/History (scroll wheel up)
- [x] Quick Save/Quick Load
- [x] Preferences (text speed, volume, fullscreen, etc.)

### UI Screens to Customize
- [ ] Main Menu (标题画面)
- [ ] In-game Textbox (对话框)
- [ ] Character Namebox (名字框)
- [ ] Game Menu (游戏菜单)
- [ ] Save/Load Screen (存档界面)
- [ ] Preferences Screen (设置界面)
- [ ] History Screen (历史记录)
- [ ] Confirm Dialogs (确认对话框)

### Additional Features
- [ ] Music room (音乐鉴赏)
- [ ] Ending flags tracking (2 endings)
- [ ] Choice system with branching paths

---

## 5. Localization Strategy

### Phase 1: Chinese (Simplified) as Default
```python
# In options.rpy
define config.language = None  # Default is Chinese
```

### Phase 2: English Translation
Ren'Py's built-in translation system:
1. Write all dialogue in Chinese first
2. Run `renpy.sh <project> translate english` to extract strings
3. Translate strings in `game/tl/english/`
4. Players can switch language in preferences

### Text Considerations
- Use appropriate Chinese fonts (思源黑体/Source Han Sans recommended)
- Set proper text speed for Chinese reading pace
- Plan for text expansion in English (~30% longer than Chinese)

---

## 6. Development Roadmap

## 8. Technical Decisions (Confirmed)

| Decision | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Base resolution | 1920x1080 (scales to 1440p) |
| Aspect ratio | 16:9 standard |
| Voice acting | No (not planned) |
| Choices/Branching | Yes - player choices, 2 endings |
| Special features | Music room only |
| Target platforms | PC primary (Steam), Mobile as stretch goal |

---

## 9. Platform & Distribution

### Steam (Primary)
Ren'Py has excellent Steam support:
- Native Steamworks integration (achievements, cloud saves)
- Easy to generate Steam-ready builds
- Many successful Ren'Py VNs on Steam

**Steam requirements we'll prepare:**
- [ ] Steam-compatible build configuration
- [ ] Achievement hooks (optional, can add later)
- [ ] Cloud save support (built into Ren'Py)
- [ ] Trading cards assets (art team responsibility)

### Mobile (Stretch Goal)
Ren'Py supports Android and iOS natively:
- **Complexity**: Low for basic support, medium for polish
- **Main consideration**: Touch-friendly UI (larger buttons, swipe gestures)
- **Approach**: Build for PC first, then test mobile build. If UI works reasonably, minimal changes needed. If not, we can add a mobile UI variant.

Ren'Py mobile features:
- Tap to advance (maps to left-click)
- Two-finger tap for menu (maps to right-click)
- Swipe for history
- Built-in touch keyboard if needed
